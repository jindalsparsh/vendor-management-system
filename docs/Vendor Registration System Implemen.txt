Vendor Registration System Implementation Plan
This project involves creating a web-based Supplier/Vendor Registration Form based on a provided reference image. The system will use PHP for the backend, MariaDB (MySQL) for the database, and HTML/CSS/JS for the frontend.

User Review Required
IMPORTANT

This application requires a PHP environment (like XAMPP, WAMP, or LAMP) with a MySQL/MariaDB server running. The 
database.sql
 script must be imported before using the form.

Proposed Changes
Database
[MODIFY] 
database.sql
Update suppliers table:
Add status column: ENUM('SUBMITTED', 'APPROVED_L1', 'APPROVED_L2', 'ACTIVE', 'REJECTED').
Add timestamp and user ID columns for approvals (e.g., l1_approved_by, l1_approved_at, etc.).
Create users table:
Columns: id, username, password_hash, role (ENUM: 'PURCHASER', 'FINANCE', 'IT').
Seed Data: Insert default users for testing (admin/purchaser/finance/it) with default passwords.
Backend (Shared)
[NEW] 
db_connect.php
Centralized database connection script.
Vendor Facing (Frontend)
[MODIFY] 
index.php
Ensure form submission points to process.php.
Add success message display.
[NEW] 
process.php
Handle new supplier insertion.
Set initial status to 'SUBMITTED'.
Internal Portal (Workflow)
[NEW] 
login.php
Simple login form.
Validates against users table.
Sets $_SESSION variables (user_id, role).
[NEW] 
dashboard.php
Protected page (requires login).
Displays table of suppliers.
Filtering Logic:
PURCHASER sees 'SUBMITTED' (needs L1).
FINANCE sees 'APPROVED_L1' (needs L2).
IT sees 'APPROVED_L2' (needs L3).
All can see 'ACTIVE' or 'REJECTED' (readonly).
[NEW] 
view_supplier.php
Read-only view of the supplier form data.
Actions Section (Dynamic based on Role + Status):
Example: If Role is Purchaser AND Status is SUBMITTED -> Show "Approve (L1)" and "Reject" buttons.
[NEW] 
workflow_action.php
Endpoint for Approve/Reject actions.
Updates status logic:
PURCHASER Approve -> Status: APPROVED_L1
FINANCE Approve -> Status: APPROVED_L2
IT Approve -> Status: ACTIVE
Records who approved and when.
Verification Plan
Manual Verification
Setup: Import updated 
database.sql
.
Vendor Flow: Open index.php, submit a form. Check DB -> Status 'SUBMITTED'.
Workflow L1: Login as Purchaser (purchaser/password). See record. Approve. Check DB -> Status 'APPROVED_L1'.
Workflow L2: Login as Finance. See record. Approve. Check DB -> Status 'APPROVED_L2'.
Workflow L3: Login as IT. See record. Approve. Check DB -> Status 'ACTIVE'.
